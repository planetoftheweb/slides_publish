Github Pages is a feature that lets you quickly host sites using your repositories. It's a great way to host static content...and it's free.

# GitHub Pages

- Publish any HTML
- Root, docs, branches
- Processing time

GitHub pages allows you to publish any type of static HTML sites. So if you just have simple HTML, you can publish that. Or you can publish an entire website using the current repository.

You can publish content that lives in the root folder of the master branch, in a folder called docs that lives on any branch, or in a separate branch.

Publishing isn't an instant process. It takes a few minutes to process the content and generate the site, so you can't really use GitHub Publishing as a Live preview.
