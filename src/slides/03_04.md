# User Repository

There is another special repository where you can make your repository homepage...and it's a bit of a secret.

# Secret Repository

- username/username
- Developer profile
- Job opportunity

If you create a repository with the same name as your account, so for me, that's planetoftheweb/planetoftheweb, then it will be displayed as your default repo when you go to github.com/username.

This is also your developer profile that is linked to your Github Profile so it's a good idea to customize it and have good information there. Take time to customize it.

A lot of companies will look through your developer profile and note the types of languages you've worked with and the repos that you've pinned, so it can contribute towards your ability to get a job.
