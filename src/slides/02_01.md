Let's talk about the GitHub UI and how it helps you manage file.

GitHub has an interface for creating, editing and deleting files and folders.

You can drag and drop files of many types directly into a repository and it will automatically be added to the repository.

There is an advanced search built into Github which lets you quickly find files anywhere inside a repository.

This makes Github itself a viable way to work and manage your sites or even host some simple files.
