# Page Domains

> >

GitHub Supports using your own domains for individual repos as well as for your entire account.

---

# Page Options

- Public or private
- Visibility
- Assigned domain

> >

Github Pages will work in either public or private repositories.

However, note that if you're using a Private repository, but you publish pages, the pages will be public, but the repository will still be private.

Github will assign a domain you can use with no setup, but you can modify that with your own custom domains.

---

# Domain Options

- `USER.github.io`
- Other repos
- Pages settings

> >

The generic domain will be your username, then .github.io. If you create a repository in this format, that will show up when you go to the main domain, wether you've customized it or not.

Any other repo you've added pages to, will use this domain, followed by the name of your project. So, for example planetoftheweb.github.io/publishing-pages

The pages tab in your settings will let you customize your domains for the APEX domain, or your individual repos.
