# 11ty Static Sites

> >

I'm going to show you 11ty, which is a librrary for publishing sites that's easier to set up than Jekyll if you want more control over your static sites.

# 11ty

- Node Based
- Zero Config
- Templating: [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/), [NunJucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/), etc
- Advanced: Node .10+

The first big advantage to 11ty is that it's based on node.js, versus Ruby, so it's more common for developers.

It's also a zero config framework by default, that means that you don't need to configure it, but it has a full set of config options if you need them.

The other cool thing about 11ty is that it is very flexible in terms of the languages and templating libaries that it works with.

It understands Liquid, which is Jekyll's templating language, but also Nunjunks, hanlebars, regular javascript and others.

I tend to stick with whatever most of the documentation is written on, so I'll be using Nunjucks. It's almost identical to Liquid anyways, you can read the docs for more information.

This is a more advanced installation for those of you who want ultimate control, so I'm assuming you're comfortable with node.js, comfortable with the terminal and VSCode.
